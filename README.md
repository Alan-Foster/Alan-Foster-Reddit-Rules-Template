# Alan-Foster-Reddit-Rules-Template
A template of [SFW Community Rules](https://github.com/Alan-Foster/Alan-Foster-Reddit-Rules-Template?tab=readme-ov-file#sfw-communities-quick-links) and [NSFW Community Rules](https://github.com/Alan-Foster/Alan-Foster-Reddit-Rules-Template?tab=readme-ov-file#nsfw-18-communities-quick-links) to establish high-quality, comprehensive guidelines for your communities. Many communities have rules that fail to encompass all rule violations or are inconsistent across communities. This rule list is designed to be a master template by which the SFW subreddits can standardize how violations are enforced. Designed for communities with content-based or safe space structures, updated and maintained to cover as many edge cases as possible.

## Should I use SFW Content or Safe Space?


> [!TIP]
> **Consider using the Content Templates if:**
- Your subreddit's purpose is for sharing content or discussing a topic
- Your members are the general public who share an interest or passion
- Your rules manage the post feed and keep content relevant
- You have enabled Reddit Discovery and Achievements for your community


> [!TIP]
> **Consider using the Safe Space Templates if:**
- The subreddit's purpose is to offer emotional or mental health support
- Your members have experienced a life-changing event that has left them vulnerable
- Your rules protect vulnerable users, not promote content
- You have disabled Reddit Discovery and Achievements for your community, because it would be in bad taste

> [!TIP]
> **In Summary:**
- Communities on Reddit are usually designed to promote content and discussions.
- Safe Spaces are designed to protect their users rather than to promote or share content.
