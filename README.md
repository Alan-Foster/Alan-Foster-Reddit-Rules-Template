# Alan-Foster-Reddit-Rules-Template
A template of [SFW Content Rules](https://github.com/Alan-Foster/Alan-Foster-Reddit-Rules-Template?tab=readme-ov-file#sfw-communities-quick-links), SAFE SPACE RULES and [NSFW Content Rules](https://github.com/Alan-Foster/Alan-Foster-Reddit-Rules-Template?tab=readme-ov-file#nsfw-18-communities-quick-links) to establish high-quality, comprehensive guidelines for your communities. Many communities have rules that fail to encompass all rule violations or are inconsistent across communities. This rule list is designed to be a master template by which the SFW subreddits can standardize how violations are enforced. Designed for communities with discussion-based rulesets or content-driven rulesets, updated and maintained to cover as many edge cases as possible.

## Should I use SFW Content or Safe Space Rules and Removal Reasons?
Communities on Reddit are usually designed to promote discussions between members or share content such as links, images, videos, etc.

> [!TIP]
> **Consider using the Content-based Templates if:**
- Your subreddit's most popular content is images, links, or videos
- Reposts are common or content is frequently stolen, especially from the 'All Time Top' posts.
- Your most common rule violations are not in text-based submission posts



> [!TIP]
> **Consider using the Safe Space Templates if:**
- Your subreddit is text-based only, with no images or links
- Reposts are uncommon because the content is usually original
- Your most common rule violations are name-calling, arguments, and disagreements between users


If you still need help deciding which ruleset to use, sort your subreddit feed by Top Posts over 7 Days and see what content type is most popular.
The majority of subreddits are content-based while still including text-based discussions.
