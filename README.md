# Alan-Foster-Reddit-Rules-Template
A template that SFW and NSFW subreddits can use to establish high-quality, comprehensive rules for their communities. Designed for communities with discussion-based rulesets or content-driven rulesets. Updated and maintained to cover as many edge cases as possible. 

## Why was this created?
Many SFW communities have rules that fail to encompass all rule violations or are inconsistent across communities. This rule list is designed to be a master template by which the SFW subreddits can standardize how violations are enforced.

## Should I use Discussion-Based or Content-Based Rules and Removal Reasons?
Communities on Reddit are usually designed around either promoting discussions between members or sharing content such as links, images, videos, etc.

**Consider using the Discussion-based Templates if:**
- Your subreddit is text-based only with no images or links
- Your most common rule violation is namecalling, arguments and disagreements between users
- Resposts are uncommon and content is usually original

**Consider using the Content-based Templates if:**
- Your subreddit's most popular content is images, links, or videos
- Your most common rule violations are not in text-based submission posts
- Reposts are common, especially from the All Time Top posts.

**What if I have all types of content in my community?**
If you still aren't sure which ruleset to use, sort your subreddit feed by Top Posts over 7 Days and see what content type is most popular.
