A template that SFW and NSFW subreddits can use to establish high-quality, comprehensive rules for their communities. Designed for communities with discussion-based rulesets or content-driven rulesets. Updated and maintained to cover as many edge cases as possible.

## Why was this created?
Many SFW communities have rules that fail to encompass all rule violations or are inconsistent across communities. This rule list is designed to be a master template by which the SFW subreddits can standardize how violations are enforced.

## How do I use this template?
Click the links above to view all of the template rules available. Copy and Paste the rules on your subreddit rule page found at https://www.reddit.com/r/SUBREDDIT/about/rules under the Moderation section of the Mod Tools page. Some rules require you to make a choice based on the way you manage your community, which are marked inside ///// sectionals \\\\\\\ to make it easy to see.

Then, navigate to https://www.reddit.com/r/SUBREDDIT/about/removal to create Removal Reasons used internally by the mod team.
