SFW Content Removal Reasons Template
Version 2025-05-20-1

Replace the content inside ///// sectionals \\\\\ to fit the rules of your subreddit.

###### PLEASE NOTE: ######
Some of these removal reasons are different from the names of the rules, such as Rule 9.
This is because there is a character limit on removal reason names.
When viewing Removals under Saved Responses, it will appear as if the Message content is cut off,
but it is just a visual display bug. Edit the rule to view the full text. Good luck!



To read this document more easily, select the options in the top right (...) and "Wrap Lines" for line text on this page.
