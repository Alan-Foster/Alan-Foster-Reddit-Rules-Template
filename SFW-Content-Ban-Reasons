SFW Content Ban Reasons Template
Version 2025-05-27-1

###### PLEASE NOTE: ######
Some of these ban reasons are different from the names of the rules, such as Rule 9.
This is because there is a character limit on ban reason names.
When viewing Removals under Saved Responses, it will appear as if the Message content is cut off,
